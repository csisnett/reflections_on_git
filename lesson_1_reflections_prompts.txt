How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file
help you see the bug that was introduced?

Viewing the difference between two versions helped me, because rather than
going through all the code I only had to focus on the different parts of
the two versions. It also helped me understand the changes made to the code
and how this affect the code in general. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

If I have different versions I can see the evolution of the file/code
I'm looking at, this is valuable to know many things about it
like why was it created in the first place? or What is the core
functionality of the function, how many people have worked on this?

Besides being useful to debug code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing
when to create a commit, like you do in Git,
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

The pros of mannualy commiting are:
1. You get one commit per change so it's easier to understand
2. If you haven't done anything significant it won't get commited
3. You can determine whether to commit or not

The cons are:
1. You may have to think what you are going to change, and keep in mind
that in some point you have to commit what you are doing which can affect
flow
2. You may forget to commit and your change won't be updated.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git allow saving
multiple files in one commit, while others treat each file separately?

I believe is allowed because when coding, a change to a file can have a significant
impact on another file, so files are interelated as we need all files for our purposes.

So we need a version control system that takes into account the need to keep track of
the changes on files and their connections to another filest are .

On the other hand other control systems handle usually single files
that do not interact with another files.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

I can enter the command git log, to see the changes a file has gone through, and then
depending on which one I'm interested see the git diff of the commit compared to the
previous one. If I wanna know how was the file before the commit I can look at the
negative lines and the rest of the lines to see how was it before the changes.

Or I can compare the commit with a really old version of the file and see most relevant changes
to the file.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Now I know, each change is registered in a commit, so I'll be able to debug, easily and correct
the mistake I've done. I will try to create unit tests and other strategies to not introduce bugs
but I definitely will not be afraid to do so.

Now that you have your workspace setup, what do you want to try using Git for?

I don't have it setup. :(

Concepts:
HEAD = current commit
detached HEAD state = you have move from the current commit
git checkout = let's the programmer change the files back temporarily to a previous commit.
(let's you change the file to a previous version temporarily)


commands of git:
git clone <repository url>: clones the repository at the current folder
git diff oldercommit newercommit <difference between commits>
git log <log of all commits>
