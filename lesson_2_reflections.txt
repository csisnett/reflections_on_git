What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

when we initialize it we create the .git folder. We need to do this in order to be able to make commits, etcetera.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

I think it provides a space for commiting several files that are interelated, and somehow it should give the user more flexibility.
